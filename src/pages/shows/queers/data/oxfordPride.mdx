# Oxford Pride

<DivWithImageRight>
<div>

At the end of each performance, we will be collecting for Oxford Pride. Run by
volunteers, Oxford Pride is a registered charity that celebrates lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender and queer life in Oxfordshire. Thank you for all your support!

We'd like to take a moment to extend our thanks to Oxford Pride for their
support of the _Queers_ project.

If you'd like to know more about, or get involved with Oxford Pride,
[you can find their website here](https://oxfordpride.uk/).
