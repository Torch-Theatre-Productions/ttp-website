Glen has performed and directed in the Oxford area for many years. Directing credits for Oxford Operatic Society at the Playhouse include _Sunset Boulevard_ (2015), _Fiddler on the Roof_ (2018) and _Calendar Girls_ (2022). He has also directed _Verity_ for Oxford author and composer, Nia Williams, for the Edinburgh Fringe 2019 and is currently directing for a musical duo-performance for this year's fringe: _Verity_ and _Dexter_.

Glen has a wide range of performing credits both in principle and supporting roles as well as ensemble. Most recently in _Evita_ at the Oxford Playhouse and in 2022 with MAC Productions in _Company_. He has played the lead role as the Baker in _Into The Woods_ (2017). Other notable performing credits include, Pablo -- _Sister Act The Musical_ (2019), Oberon _A Midsummer Nights Dream_ (2016), Jigger -- _Carousel_ (2014), Lumiere -- _Disney's Beauty and the Beast_ (2012), Ralph - _The Sound of Music_ (2003), and King Pelius - _Jason and the Argonauts_ (2005).

Glen is excited to work with Torch Productions on their inaugural project and hopes you find as much to reflect on in the narratives as he has; both in celebration of how far LGBTQ acceptance has come in the last 100 years and aspiration for that to be even better in the future.
