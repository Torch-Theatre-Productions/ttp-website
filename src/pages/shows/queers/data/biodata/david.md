days. Favourite roles have included the Shamrayev (_The Seagull_), Duke
Frederick (_As You Like It_), Revd Parris (_The Crucible_), Mr Alfieri (_A View
from the Bridge_) and Dr Livesey (_Treasure Island_), all with Oxford Theatre
Guild; Dwornitschek (_The Play’s the Thing_) and M de Tréville (_The Three
Musketeers_) with ElevenOne Theatre; Mr Woodhouse (_Emma_) and Leonato (_Much

evenings, and for local theatre companies including Oxford Dance Theatre, Oxford
