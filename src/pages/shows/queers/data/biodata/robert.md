Robert started performing from an early age, appearing in COTG shows while still
at school. National Youth Theatre and Guildford School of Acting followed, and
then a variety of parts in Fringe Theatre, Open-air Shakespeare, children’s
touring theatre and more. Since 2000 he has been running the **Burton Taylor
Studio** full-time, but keeps his hand in by taking on the occasional acting role
when time allows.

Notable roles over the years have included: Pontius Pilate in _Jesus Christ Superstar_;
Arturo Ui in _‘The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui’_; Gloucester in _King Lear_; Rock
Star’s Alter Ego in _'Pink Floyd’s The Wall'_; Polonius in _Hamlet_; Bottom in
_Midsummer Night’s Dream_; Sir Chiffley Lockheart in Ben Elton's _'Gasping'_; and
various parts in touring ensemble shows ‘Hey Nicaragua!’, ‘Animal’s Revolt’ and
many others.

Robert has relished the opportunity and challenge of taking on this part in the
studio he runs!
