After gaining a Foundation Degree with Distinction in Writing for Performance from Ruskin College Oxford, Wayne graduated with 1st Class Hons in Creative Writing from Brunel University.

Wayne was commissioned by The Oxford Beatles and ElevenOne Theatre to write _The Sgt. Pepper Show_ about the final year in the life of Brian Epstein. His one-act script Dynamo Flo won the Oxfordshire Drama Networking Playwriting Competition, and he is currently working with a musical director to adapt it into a full-length original musical. Wayne was Creative Director of a new musical _Melody_ by Nia Williams, which played at venues around the UK.

In 2021 Wayne directed 15 women performing 35 of Shakespeare monologues, sonnets and songs, which he also filmed and edited. A selection of the performances were screened online at Brighton Fringe and Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and the entire collection was screened on Scenesaver---a digital platform for creative work.
