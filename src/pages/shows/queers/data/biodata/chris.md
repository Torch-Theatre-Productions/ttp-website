Chris has been seen regularly on stage performing various roles in musical
theatre for over 15 years, despite his "_young and innocent_" face. Recent roles
include Jenkin Lewis, Arthur the Bugler, Courtier Two, Street Crier and Princess
Anne (not a typo) in the multi-role chaos that was _Mrs Pack_, performed at the
Edinburgh Fringe in 2022 (**Three Chairs and a Hat**), Paul in
_Company_ at the OFS in February 2022 (**MAC Productions**) and Arthur
Kipps in _Half a Sixpence_ (**Solihull Theatre Company**).

Chris would like to personally thank Glen for working with him on _More Anger_
as well as tapping him on the shoulder for _Dexter_ over two years ago, which
ultimately led to his involvement in _Mrs Pack_, _Dexter_ and _Verity_. Chris
would like to dedicate this performance to his parents, who have always been a
fountain of support, as well as all the ex-boyfriends that have given him enough
angst to work with for this performance.
