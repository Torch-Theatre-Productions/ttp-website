# Welcome

Hello and welcome to the Burton Taylor Studio and this production of _Queers_,
brought to you by **Torch Theatre Productions Oxford**!

If we were to travel back in time to about a year ago, you would find Tora and
myself in a sunny garden; each with a glass of white wine. We would casually be
talking about our Oxford theatre experiences and our mutual love for a couple of
musicals that don't receive wider recognition. "But nobody would put these shows
on", you would hear us say, "there's not enough demand for shows like these, and
the bigger, more established groups need to meet the needs of their membership."

"We should start a theatre company and just do it ourselves!" you would hear us
joke.

But now, here we are in the Burton Taylor Studio. I will be honest with you, it
doesn't seem quite real, and it's very important to acknowledge that it would not
be real without a few key people.

Firstly, a massive thank you to **Tora**. If you don't know her, Tora is an
absolute powerhouse who is on top of quite literally everything at all times. I
have no idea how she does it, but be assured there would be no _Queers_, no
Torch, without her.

Secondly, to **our cast and directors** (not you, Glen), who have been so
enthusiastic and supportive of the project. From casting through to the
production of the final pieces, it's been a pleasure to work with you all.

Thirdly, to our amazing production duo of **Gavin and Will**, who have a wealth
of experience in their respective areas. Since this is Torch's first full-budget
production, it can be difficult to be sure whether you're on track to succeed,
but knowing these two have your back helps a lot.

And finally, to **you!** Thank you so much for grabbing a ticket and coming to
support us. This project means a lot to us all, and I hope that some of the
pieces you're about to see move you in the ways they've moved us.

**Chris Johnstone**
