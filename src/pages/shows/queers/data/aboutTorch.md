# About Torch Theatre Productions Oxford

We formed Torch Theatre Productions Oxford in 2022 and staged a fundraising
concert at Somerville College in December 2022. We became a registered Community
Interest Company in February 2023. Our aim is to provide opportunities for
people in the local community to engage with theatre as audience members and
performers, and in creative and technical roles.
