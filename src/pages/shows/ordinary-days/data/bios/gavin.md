Gavin is excited to be stage managing his second show for Torch with a show he
first saw in a church crypt at the Edinburgh fringe in 2022. From a dry ice
laden *Godspell* at school, to more recent shows with OXOPS, MAC, Torch, and
BMH, Gavin has been loving life backstage for more years than he cares to
remember. Recent stage management jobs have included a set on wheels for *Dirty
Rotten Scoundrels (MAC)*, multiple directors for *Queers (Torch)*, and a
disappearing set for *The Father (BMH)*.

He is though especially proud of this show as it marks the directorial debut of
his wife, Victoria.
