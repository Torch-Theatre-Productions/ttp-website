Chris is excited to be performing in Torch's first musical production. Recent
roles include **Jenkin Lewis**, **Arthur the Bugler**, **Courtier Two**,
**Street Crier** and **Princess Anne** (not a typo) in the multi-role chaos that
was _Mrs Pack_, first performed at the Edinburgh Fringe festival in 2022 and
again at the Camden fringe festival in 2024 (Three Chairs and a Hat). Other
roles include **Phil** in *Queers* (Torch), **Dexter** in both *Dexter* and
*Verity* (Three Chairs and a Hat), **Paul** in *Company* (MAC Productions) and
**Arthur Kipps** in *Half a Sixpence* (Solihull Theatre Company).

Chris would like to extend a huge thank you to Tora for all the hard work she's
poured into this show and hopes we do her vision justice! He'd also like to
thank the rest of the cast - the rehearsal space has always been a joy.
