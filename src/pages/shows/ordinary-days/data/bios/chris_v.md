Chris began his journey in musical direction as the Assistant Musical Director
for RicNic Oxford's 2015 production of *Into the Woods*. He was later Musical
Director for Sheffield University Performing Arts Societyâ€™s productions of
*Urinetown*, *Fiddler on the Roof* and *Into the Woods*. In addition to music
directing, Chris has also lent his piano skills in recent years to productions
