This is James' first performance since returning from Australia where, in a
12-year period, he trained at NIDA, performed in Sydney, Melbourne and Regional
Victoria *(Jekyll and Hyde, Les Mis√©rables, 42nd Street, Guys and Dolls, Chess,
Miss Saigon, First Date and Shrek)* and led the Melbourne Singers of Gospel.
Originally from Oxford, James grew up performing with MYCO and OXOPS with roles
including **Max Bialystock** *(The Producers)*, **Julian Marsh** *(42nd
Street)*, **Jud Fry** *(Oklahoma!)*, **Chino** *(West Side Story)*, **Strephon**
*(Iolanthe)*, **Marco** *(The Gondoliers)*, **Nicely-Nicely Johnson** *(Guys and
Dolls)* and **Samuel** *(The Pirates of Penzance)*. Roles with Troika Theatre
include **Feste** *(Twelfth Night)*, **Lennox** *(Macbeth)* and **Lord Capulet**
*(Romeo and Juliet)*.


James dedicates this performance to his sister Louise who sadly passed away this
time last year. As a talented artist, singer and performer she would have surely
loved this show. She is deeply missed by all that knew her.
