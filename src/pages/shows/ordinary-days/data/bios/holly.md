Though this is Holly's first time performing with Torch, she has been a member
of Oxford Operatic Society since 2020 and has performed in shows including
*Oliver!*, *Evita*, and most recently as a featured dancer in *Funny Girl*. Holly was
first introduced to performing as a dancer, and danced competitively throughout
school and university.

Taking on the role of Deb has therefore pushed Holly to
step out of her comfort zone and explore a more character-driven production in
*Ordinary Days*. She would like to thank her family and friends for their
continued support.
