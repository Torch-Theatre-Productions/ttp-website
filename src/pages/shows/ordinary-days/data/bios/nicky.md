Having studied at Birmingham Theatre School where she gained a Diploma in
Acting, Nicky has been lucky enough to play some wonderful roles since then,
including **Beryl** in *Made in Dagenham* (MAC Productions); **Marie** in *Calendar Girls*
(Oxford Operatic Society) and **Woman** in *The Father* (BMH Productions). Nicky is
one of the co-founders of MAC Productions and is immensely proud of what the
company has achieved, celebrating 10 years of MAC in 2023. She also loves
directing and has directed shows for both Oxford Operatic Society and MAC. 

Nicky would like to thank Torch for the opportunity of being involved in
*Ordinary Days*, itâ€™s been an absolute privilege.
