## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to everybody for their support in bringing this production to
life. There are many people behind the scenes for their dedication and hard
work.

Big thank you to our very own Hannah Veale for taking our wonderful
headshots, as well as finding our dress rehearsal photographer.

Another big thank you to Yomi Ikuru for giving some of his free time to tag
along to rehearsals to take some photos for us. If you've seen any action shots
on our socials, those are all Yomi!

Finally, thank you to Anna Hughes and Guy Grimsley for being our understudies.
Anna and Guy have attended various rehearsals as well as spent some time with
our wonderful MD Chris Ventom to prepare them just in case.
