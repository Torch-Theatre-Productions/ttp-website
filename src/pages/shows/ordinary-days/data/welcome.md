## Welcome, Ladies, Gentlemen, and Theatre Enthusiasts!

Welcome to tonight’s performance of *Ordinary Days*—a show that, after weeks of
laughter, tears, and enough coffee to keep a small country awake, we are
thrilled to finally present to you. My name is Bing Bongsley, and as the (mostly) proud
Chairman of Bonging Theatre, I’d like to take a moment to thank you for
being here tonight. We couldn’t do it without you. Really—we tried. It was very
quiet. And a little creepy.

Let me just say, this rehearsal process has been a *journey*. We started with high
hopes, a script, and a couple of tuneless whistles—but as the days progressed,
so did the drama. Not just on stage, mind you, but off-stage too. I won't lie to
you—there were moments we thought we were living an episode of *Survivor: Theatre
Edition.*

Now, if you’ll indulge me, I must tell you about the giraffe incident. No,
that’s not a typo. It was Tuesday, 2:34 p.m. (yes, I remember the time, it's
burned into my brain), when someone—still unnamed, but we have suspicions—left
the back door open at the rehearsal space. And in strolled Gerald. Gerald, the
giraffe. Where he came from, no one knows. Why he chose our theatre company to
grace with his towering presence? Another mystery. For a good 20 minutes, we
debated whether we could somehow cast him as a very tall extra, but alas, his
demands for a three-story trailer were simply out of budget.

Anyway, after a lot of phone calls to animal control, a very distressed props
manager, and some truly innovative choreography adjustments to avoid the large
animal in the middle of the room, Gerald was safely escorted out (though I’m
convinced he would’ve nailed the role of "New Yorker #3").

In all seriousness, it’s been an unforgettable, wild, and truly rewarding
process bringing *Ordinary Days* to life. Our cast and crew have worked tirelessly
(except for when they were chasing down rogue wildlife), and they’ve created
something truly special for you all tonight.

So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. If anything unexpected happens
tonight... just assume it’s part of the performance. Trust me, after the last
few weeks, *anything* is possible.

Thank you for your support, for coming to the theatre, and for laughing along
with us—even when it involves giraffes.

Break a leg, everyone!

With wild enthusiasm and a few grey hairs,<br/>
Bing Bongsley<br/>
Chairman, Bonging Theatre
