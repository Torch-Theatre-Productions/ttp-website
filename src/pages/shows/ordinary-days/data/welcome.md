# Welcome

Welcome to the Old Fire Station and our production of *Ordinary Days*.

The idea for Torch grew out of our mutual love for little known musicals
including *Ordinary Days*. We realised there might be a space in Oxford's amateur
theatre scene for intimate, understated shows with small casts. Our first
production was *Queers*, a series of monologues celebrating British gay history,
at the Burton Taylor Theatre in June 2023. We were delighted to be asked to
reprise some of the monologues at Ramsden Memorial Hall in March 2024.

Following the success of *Queers*, we decided to take the plunge and stage our
first musical. It's been an incredible experience and wouldn't have been
possible without the dedication and support of many people.

**Chris Ventom** who has not only been a fantastic Musical Director, but has also
accompanied all the rehearsals and performances. Given the show is completely
sung through he rarely gets a break and is arguably the hardest working member
of the team!

**Nicky Robinson** who has supported me brilliantly throughout the
process. As a first-time Director, I could not have asked for a better
mentor.

**James**, **Holly** and **Hannah** for your talent, hard work and enthusiasm.
It's been an absolute joy having you in the show.

**Gavin** and **Will** for your skill and experience behind the scenes. We
couldn't do this without you. 

**Guy Grimsley** and **Anna Hughes** for agreeing to be our understudies. We
really appreciate you taking the time to attend rehearsals and familiarise
yourselves with the show.

and we really enjoyed meeting you all.
