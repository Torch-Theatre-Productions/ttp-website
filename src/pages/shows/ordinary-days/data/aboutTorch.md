# About Torch Theatre Productions Oxford

We formed Torch Theatre Productions Oxford in 2022 and staged a fundraising
concert at Somerville College in December 2022. We became a registered Community
Interest Company in February 2023. Our aim is to provide opportunities for
people in the local community to engage with theatre as audience members and
performers, and in creative and technical roles.

If you have ever wondered what it takes to produce theatre, and would be
interested in getting involved, please get in touch with us! There is so much
scope for creativity when producing theatre, and a lot of it is off-stage - from
writing press releases to recording and editing video. If this appeals to you,
[sling us an email](mailto:torchtheatreproductions@gmail.com).
