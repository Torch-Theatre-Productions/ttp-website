<p>We are delighted to welcome you to the Burton Taylor Studio and this performance of Queers.</p>
<h1>About <strong>&quot;Queers&quot;</strong></h1>
<p>Queers was first broadcast on BBC4 in July 2017. Curated by Mark Gatiss, the
monologues were commissioned to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1967 Sexual
Offences Act. They celebrate a century of evolving social attitudes and
political milestones in British gay history as seen through the eyes of
different individuals.</p>

in Queers</a></p>
<p>In 2018 the Oxford Theatre Guild performed three of the monologues at local
drama festivals. Directed by Simon Tavener, the cast included Victoria. We are
excited to be restaging Missing Alice along with five of the other monologues to
celebrate 20 years of Oxford Pride and the 10th anniversary of the 2013 Marriage
(Same Sex Couples Act).</p>
